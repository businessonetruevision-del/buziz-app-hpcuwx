[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I want to design an app called Buziz. It should act as a lightweight business control panel for small businesses and teams, with a clean black-and-white theme. The app will allow users to manage shifts, tasks, inventory, suppliers, staff, and internal communication in one place.\r\n\r\nWhen a user registers, they are asked to either create an office or join an office. If creating, the user enters their name and is automatically assigned Employee #00001. The creator receives a unique office code to invite others. New members joining with this code enter their name and are assigned an auto-generated employee number (#00002, #00003, etc.). The creator can create custom roles themselves (e.g., Manager, Cashier, Technician, Editor) and define role permissions. Roles can be used to assign shifts and tasks to multiple people at once and to set permission levels (for example, managers can edit schedules while regular staff can only view). The creator can designate staff members as Head Managers; Head Managers have the same permissions as the creator (manage roles, tasks, shifts, inventory, suppliers, announcements, and more) but cannot remove or demote the creator.\r\n\r\nCore features include shift scheduling where managers can create shifts and assign them to specific employees or entire roles; employees view shifts in a shared calendar; an optional check-in/check-out system tracks attendance and hours. Task management supports creating tasks with title, description, deadline, and priority; tasks can be assigned to individuals or roles (notifying all relevant users) and tracked by status (To Do, In Progress, Done). Inventory and supply management supports tracking merchandise, supplies, and stock; adding suppliers with contact info and provided items; setting low-stock alerts and restock reminders; and recording usage history (e.g., \u201c10 bottles sold last week,\u201d \u201cPrinter ink replaced yesterday\u201d). Internal communication is provided via a message board/announcements tab with role-specific announcements so messages can target groups like Managers, reducing reliance on external chat apps.\r\n\r\nAdditional features include an auto-generated employee directory showing all staff with names, employee numbers, and roles plus quick contact access; a reports dashboard summarizing hours worked, task completion rates, inventory levels and low-stock alerts, and supplier performance (e.g., late deliveries); role-based notifications with customizable delivery (push, email, in-app) so assigning a task to a role alerts all members; and future multi-office support allowing one user to belong to multiple offices. Payroll Lite exports timesheets based on shifts and check-ins with pay-rate per role for wage calculations. Mobile barcode scanning enables quick inventory updates. A lightweight CRM module tracks customer orders, completion status, and per-customer order history. Integrations include syncing shifts and tasks with Google Calendar and pushing announcements via WhatsApp or Slack."}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I understand.
